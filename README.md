Yeh! A easy way to create your landing page.

</div>

## Why

When starting a side project, I have to take care of many auxiliary tasks
that may not seem critical but cannot be ignored, such as building a simple landing page or FAQ section.

I donâ€™t want to repeatedly copy and paste the same code. And I really have
no need for a full CMS. So I built this to help me manage those mundane chores.

Hope you guys find this useful!

## Features

- **Simple**: You only need a single line of code to launch your product website.
- **Powerful**: It can be extended with many functional blocks, including FAQ, pricing, etc.
- **Multi-framework**: It supports React frameworks like Gatsby and Next.js.
- **Customizable**: You can easily customize your own unique theme through custom themes.

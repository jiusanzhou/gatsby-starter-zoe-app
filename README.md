# `zoe app`

Yeh! A easy way to manage your site or application stuff.

</div>

When I want to start a side project, I need to care about lots of things
which may not the real matter, but I have no choice to let them go, things
like:

- version release: release a new version of application
- change log: a landing page to preview change logs
- user agreement and privacy policy:
- a landing page:
- help documents:
- Q&A:
- some simple json pieces:
- media data: logo or banner or something else

I don't want to re copy and paste those code again and again. And I real have
no need to use a CMS. So I build this to help me to manage those boring things.

Hope your guys enjoy it!
